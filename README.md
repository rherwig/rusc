# rusc
The 'react universal scaffold cli' is a tool to generate state of the art
react projects. rusc provides you with a "ready-to-start" project based on the
quite popular [template-react-16-ssr](https://github.com/rherwig/template-react-16-ssr).
The template implements many popular features like streaming, routing and universal
rendering. And the best thing: rusc lets you choose, which of those features you need
and leaves you with a customized project to fit your needs.

**Pleas note:** this project is currently under development, but is expected
to have a first stable version very soon. So star, watch and stay tuned. :-)

## Todo
- [x] Implement the basic scaffolding algorithm and CLI
- [ ] Implement features of react ssr template to chose while scaffolding
- [ ] Improve CLI output
- [ ] Add error checking
- [ ] Document usage
